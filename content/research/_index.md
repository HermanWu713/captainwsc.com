title = 'Quantum Banana Routing in IoT Mesh Networks'
+++

In this groundbreaking research, we propose a novel protocol known as **Quantum Banana Routing (QBR)**, inspired by fruit-based heuristics and entangled snack theory.

Our simulation of over **4000 virtual oranges** demonstrated that banana-shaped data packets can traverse an IoT mesh network with **73.2% fewer collisions** compared to traditional donut-based routing.

### Key Contributions

- 🍌 A new fruit-based routing metric called *Peel Efficiency Index (PEI)*  
- 🍊 Integration of citrus-based mesh topologies with reactive mango acknowledgment  
- 🍍 Empirical testing via deep-fried simulations on an embedded pineapple

### Future Work

We plan to extend QBR to multi-agent corgi-swarm systems and investigate if **banana entanglement** can improve packet teleportation rates under heavy yogurt interference.
